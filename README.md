Title: The In and Out of Queues

Author: Michael Webber

The song I created is a funny and somehwat educational song about Queues. We often use Queues in Java, and it is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure that has many benefits. I played around with the FIFO idea to create an unique title surrounding Queues. I did not want this song to be purely educational, because I wanted to make sure the viewer would stay engaged throughout the whole song. I try to use humor surrounding the difficulty of queues and how they can be hard to understand at first, but are eventually easy to use. Most people know that this is a general trend through all of computer science. At first, new coding techniques seem quite tricky, but after practice with each new aspect, it becomes much easier.

In terms of the song, the underlying beat is relatively constant throughout. It follows a four measure sequence that is mirrored in the back half of the song. The only big switch up that occurs is during the chorus, where the piano gets more dynamic for the eight measures. The rhythm for the vocals goes relatively unchanged as well. Depending on the number of words in each measure there is some variation, but I created a general pattern and tried to stick to that throughout the whole piece. I wanted there to be a lot of consistent aspects so that it would be easy to follow along to the words. There was not any live coding that was done when the recording was made.
